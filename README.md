# Bool-Quiz-Game
the very first part is that this quiz game is an oop project that we create objects unlike the previous project(coffee machine) 
the project consists of four different files:
#### data.py:
  this file contains the questions with their answer in true and false text mode 
#### main.py:
  in this file we convert our dictionary from the other file(data.py) to class object and append them to a list 
  for further developements of preoject
